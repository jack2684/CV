\section{Professional Experience}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{04/2016 -- Present}
     {Software Engineer @ Airbnb}
     {Service Framework}
     
     Work on service framework that enable other engineers to build standard microservices in Airbnb. Before that worked on scaling memcached with mcrouter and scaling redis with twemproxy.
     

\item{04/2015 -- 02/2016}
     {Software Engineer @ Amazon AWS}
     {AWS Lambda}
     
     1) Worked on function versioning, a demanding feature to manage version and alias of Lambda function.  2) Implemented a test account pool service to avoid tests resource conflicts, which makes test parallelization possible. 3) Implemented a map-reduce-base analyser, which reduces analyzing terabytes of data from several days to a few hours. 4) Built more fine grain metrics for the service.

\item{06/2014 -- 08/2014}
     {Software Engineer Intern @ Amazon AWS}
     {Builder Tools, Package Builder Services}
     
    1) Implemented a feature to automize the process of pruning and unpruning broken package. 2) Implemented package build history API.
     
\item{09/2012 -- 02/2013}
     {Research Assistant @ NetLab, Tsinghua University}
     {DCloud: Deadline Guaranteed Cloud Computing}
     
     1) Designed a new datacenter resource allocation mechanism, by introducing job deadline when scheduling. 2) Wrote a resource allocation simulation program, and built a linear model to compute optimal results using IBM Cplex. 3) Validated the efficiency in a 16-machine cluster running Hadoop.
     \\\\
     Increase job throughput by 30$\scriptsize{\sim}$50\% comparing to state-of-art. Submitted to ACM SIGCOMM 2013.

\item{08/2011 -- 07/2012}
     {Software Developer @ Innovation Project Center of BUPT}
     {SIDES: Scalable Intelligent Distributed Emergency System}
     
     1) Implemented a decentralized self-organize wireless-based emergency system that generates real-time evacuation strategy to save lives in fire hazard. 2) Designed the learning protocol for distributed sensor nodes, And implemented in Zigbee.
\\\\
Shorten evacuation by 50\% comparing to normal strategy, Won first prize as National Class Innovation Project.
