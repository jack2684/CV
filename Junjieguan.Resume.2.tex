\section{Professional Experience}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{Apr 2015 -- Present}
     {SDE @ Amazon AWS}
     {AWS Lambda}

     \quad Major experiences:

     \quad1) Lambda function versioning. A  demanding feature that affect almost almost all the APIs and underneath function management architecture.
     
     \quad2) Implement a test account pool service. This avoids tests resource conflicts and unexpected account state change. Also it makes test parallelization possible.
     
     \quad3) Implement a map reduce log analysis tool, which reduce analysing Terabytes of data from serveral days, to a few hours.

     \quad4) Build fine grain monitors and metrics upon the service. 


\item{Jun 2014 -- Aug 2014}
     {SDE Intern @ Amazon AWS}
     {Builder Tools, Package Builder Services}
     
     \quad1) Implement the Auto-Unprune feature to relief customer from tedious working around broken packages.
     
     \quad2) Implement pacakge build history API as strech project.
     
     
\item{Sep 2012 -- Feb 2013}
     {Research Assistant @ NetLab, Tsinghua University}
     {DCloud: Deadline Guaranteed Cloud Computing}
     
     \quad1) Design a new datacenter resource allocation mechanism, by considering deadline into job scheduling;
     
     \quad2) Build thousands of lines of C++ simulations program;
     
     \quad3) Implementation on a 16-machine cluster, writing controling  program with Python and Bash shell;
     
     \quad4) Validating efficiency with Hadoop application using; Java, 
     
     \quad5) Try compare with optimal solution using IBM Cplex;
	\\\\
     Increase job throughput by 30$\scriptsize{\sim}$50\% comparing to state-of-art, submitted to ACM SIGCOMM 2013.
